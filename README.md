The University Guide project is an informative web application that helps students easily explore and compare the requirements for pursuing Master's degrees across universities worldwide. The project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface where students can access essential information about universities, including their admission requirements, courses offered, and other relevant details.
The main goal of the University Guide project was to create a tool that could assist students in finding the right university based on their academic aspirations and preferences. By providing detailed information about different universities and the application process, it aims to reduce the time and effort involved in researching universities across the globe.
